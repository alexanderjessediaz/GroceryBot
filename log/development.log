Bake for 3 to 4 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant be sure to set a timer; we’re toasting at high heat here.\n 5.Spread the toasted seeds/nuts over the salad. Top with the crumbled feta, green onion and dried cranberries.\n 6.If you’re serving the salad immediately, go ahead and drizzle most of the dressing on top you probably won’t use it all. Gently toss to combine, and let the salad rest for a few minutes so the rice has time to absorb some of the dressing. Serve.\n 7.If you’re planning to have leftovers, divide the salad into portions and store the dressing separately. The salad and dressing will keep well, each covered in the refrigerator, for up to 5 days. Leftover dressing is great to keep on hand for future salads!"], ["cook_time", 1.1], ["image", "https://cookieandkate.com/images/2019/01/hearty-sweet-potato-arugula-wild-rice-salad-with-ginger-dressing-recipe.jpg"], ["whats_for_dinner_bot_id", 33], ["created_at", "2020-03-05 23:06:28.500036"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-05 23:06:28.500036"]]

Immediately add 1 ½ teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom. Cook until they are just lightly set, flipping or stirring along the way. Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof spatula.\n    3.Return the pan to heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n    4.Add the remaining veggies and salt. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally don’t stir too often, or the veggies won’t have a chance to turn golden on the edges, until the veggies are cooked through and turning golden, about 3 to 5 more minutes. In the meantime, use the edge of your spatula or a spoon to break up the scrambled eggs into smaller pieces.\n    5.Use a big spatula or spoon to transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl with the cooked eggs. Return the pan to heat and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and mix it all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n    6.Add the greens if using and green onions, and stir to combine. Add the cooked veggies and eggs and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tamari and sesame oil. Taste, and add a little more tamari if you’d like more soy flavor don’t overdo it or it will drown out the other flavors or salt, if the dish needs an extra boost of overall flavor.\n    7. Divide into bowls and serve immediately. I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the side. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 to 4 days if you used purple cabbage, it might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color, but it’s fine to eat."], ["cook_time", 0.35], ["image", "https://cookieandkate.com/images/2017/05/vegetable-fried-rice.jpg"], ["whats_for_dinner_bot_id", 36], ["created_at", "2020-03-05 23:06:28.510249"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-05 23:06:28.510249"]]

Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow, for 40 minutes to 55 minutes, until the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes, then remove the lid, stir in ¼ teaspoon of the salt, and set aside.\n 2.Meanwhile, to roast the sweet potatoes: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Place the cubed sweet potato on the pan, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Toss until the sweet potatoes are lightly and evenly coated in oil. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing halfway, until they are caramelized on the edges and tender when pierced through with a fork. Leave the oven on and let the sweet potatoes cool for a few minutes.\n 3.To make the dressing, simply combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined. Set aside.\n Combine the arugula, wild rice and roasted sweet potatoes keep the parchment paper in a large serving bowl or platter.\n 4.Spread the seeds and/or chopped nuts on your parchment-covered baking sheet. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant be sure to set a timer; we’re toasting at high heat here.\n 5.Spread the toasted seeds/nuts over the salad. Top with the crumbled feta, green onion and dried cranberries.\n 6.If you’re serving the salad immediately, go ahead and drizzle most of the dressing on top you probably won’t use it all. Gently toss to combine, and let the salad rest for a few minutes so the rice has time to absorb some of the dressing. Serve.\n 7.If you’re planning to have leftovers, divide the salad into portions and store the dressing separately. The salad and dressing will keep well, each covered in the refrigerator, for up to 5 days. Leftover dressing is great to keep on hand for future salads!"], ["cook_time", 1.1], ["image", "https://cookieandkate.com/images/2019/01/hearty-sweet-potato-arugula-wild-rice-salad-with-ginger-dressing-recipe.jpg"], ["whats_for_dinner_bot_id", 41], ["created_at", "2020-03-06 18:57:10.004596"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-06 18:57:10.004596"]]

Before you get started, make sure that all of your ingredients are prepped and within an arm’s reach from the stove. Also have an empty bowl nearby for holding the cooked eggs and veggies. I’m suggesting that you start over medium-high heat, but if at any point you catch a whiff of oil or food burning, reduce the heat to medium.\n    2.Warm a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until a few drops of water evaporate within a couple of seconds. Immediately add 1 ½ teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom. Cook until they are just lightly set, flipping or stirring along the way. Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof spatula.\n    3.Return the pan to heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n    4.Add the remaining veggies and salt. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally don’t stir too often, or the veggies won’t have a chance to turn golden on the edges, until the veggies are cooked through and turning golden, about 3 to 5 more minutes. In the meantime, use the edge of your spatula or a spoon to break up the scrambled eggs into smaller pieces.\n    5.Use a big spatula or spoon to transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl with the cooked eggs. Return the pan to heat and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and mix it all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n    6.Add the greens if using and green onions, and stir to combine. Add the cooked veggies and eggs and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tamari and sesame oil. Taste, and add a little more tamari if you’d like more soy flavor don’t overdo it or it will drown out the other flavors or salt, if the dish needs an extra boost of overall flavor.\n    7. Divide into bowls and serve immediately. I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the side. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 to 4 days if you used purple cabbage, it might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color, but it’s fine to eat."], ["cook_time", 0.35], ["image", "https://cookieandkate.com/images/2017/05/vegetable-fried-rice.jpg"], ["whats_for_dinner_bot_id", 44], ["created_at", "2020-03-06 18:57:10.015914"], ["updated_at", "2020-03-06 18:57:10.015914"]]

Before you get started, make sure that all of your ingredients are prepped and within an arm’s reach from the stove. Also have an empty bowl nearby for holding the cooked eggs and veggies. I’m suggesting that you start over medium-high heat, but if at any point you catch a whiff of oil or food burning, reduce the heat to medium.\n   2.Warm a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until a few drops of water evaporate within a couple of seconds. Immediately add 1 ½ teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom. Cook until they are just lightly set, flipping or stirring along the way. Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof spatula.\n   3.Return the pan to heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n   4.Add the remaining veggies and salt. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally don’t stir too often, or the veggies won’t have a chance to turn golden on the edges, until the veggies are cooked through and turning golden, about 3 to 5 more minutes. In the meantime, use the edge of your spatula or a spoon to break up the scrambled eggs into smaller pieces.\n   5.Use a big spatula or spoon to transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl with the cooked eggs. Return the pan to heat and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and mix it all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n   6.Add the greens if using and green onions, and stir to combine. Add the cooked veggies and eggs and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tamari and sesame oil. Taste, and add a little more tamari if you’d like more soy flavor don’t overdo it or it will drown out the other flavors or salt, if the dish needs an extra boost of overall flavor.\n   7. Divide into bowls and serve immediately. I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the side. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 to 4 days if you used purple cabbage, it might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color, but it’s fine to eat."], ["prep_time", 0.2], ["cook_time", 0.15], ["total_time", 0.35], ["image", "https://cookieandkate.com/images/2017/05/vegetable-fried-rice.jpg"], ["created_at", "2020-04-15 20:07:45.190587"], ["updated_at", "2020-04-15 20:07:45.190587"]]

Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow, for 40 minutes to 55 minutes, until the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes, then remove the lid, stir in ¼ teaspoon of the salt, and set aside.\n   2.Meanwhile, to roast the sweet potatoes: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Place the cubed sweet potato on the pan, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Toss until the sweet potatoes are lightly and evenly coated in oil. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing halfway, until they are caramelized on the edges and tender when pierced through with a fork. Leave the oven on and let the sweet potatoes cool for a few minutes.\n   3.To make the dressing, simply combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined. Set aside.\n   Combine the arugula, wild rice and roasted sweet potatoes keep the parchment paper in a large serving bowl or platter.\n   4.Spread the seeds and/or chopped nuts on your parchment-covered baking sheet. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant be sure to set a timer; we’re toasting at high heat here.\n   5.Spread the toasted seeds/nuts over the salad. Top with the crumbled feta, green onion and dried cranberries.\n   6.If you’re serving the salad immediately, go ahead and drizzle most of the dressing on top you probably won’t use it all. Gently toss to combine, and let the salad rest for a few minutes so the rice has time to absorb some of the dressing. Serve.\n   7.If you’re planning to have leftovers, divide the salad into portions and store the dressing separately. The salad and dressing will keep well, each covered in the refrigerator, for up to 5 days. Leftover dressing is great to keep on hand for future salads!"], ["prep_time", 0.2], ["cook_time", 0.5], ["total_time", 1.1], ["image", "https://cookieandkate.com/images/2019/01/hearty-sweet-potato-arugula-wild-rice-salad-with-ginger-dressing-recipe.jpg"], ["created_at", "2020-04-15 20:07:45.196183"], ["updated_at", "2020-04-15 20:07:45.196183"]]
